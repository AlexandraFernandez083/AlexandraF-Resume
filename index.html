        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music Teacher ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a full time student at the University of California, Riverside, and plan on pursuing my Masters after I obtain my bachelors. I have experience with work as well, having taken an on-campus job, prior to the pandemic. Juggling being a full time student on top of having an 18 hour job week has given me beneficial skills in terms of organization and job management, which I find are both important in the current line of work I am pursuing, concerning my major. I also plan on searching for and doing internships as soon as possible, and continuing it through graduate school. I currently have no plans to minor in any specific field, but the possibility is still there. I hope to continue my education soon after I graduate, and be able to absorb as much knowledge as I can in the time that is given to me.<br><br>

        As a musician, I have around 7 years of experience with flute, having played in my respective schools band programs throughout the years. Additionally, I have around 4 years of experience with marching band, having participated in my high schools band program. Currently I am pursuing taking on a variety of other instruments as well, such as planning to begin to professionally learn the piano, and even undertake other instruments such as brass instruments. I am also planning on furthering my composing knowledge, and hopefully creating my own pieces to share in a professional manner as well. I hope to obtain as much knowledge as possible, to be both the best musician and the best music teacher I can be. I hope to also apply for any gigs with any band or other performance settings, throughout the coming years. While I do have some job experience, I hope to gain some experience with jobs that concern music as well, in a variety of fields. It does not necessarily need to be a performance setting.<br><br>

        Music is very important to me, and has been a part of my life ever since I was young. I wouldn't have kept with it for so long, overcoming challenges and own self doubts, if it didn't matter to me. Its the reason why I'm pursuing it as a career; I love the experiences that it can give. And I want to be able to give those experiences to others. The joy and fun I have performing, in both concert settings and during my old marching band days were and still are indescribable. I still remember the bonds I created with others. It is both upsetting and disappointing to me that in our current times, the Arts are neglected in our educational settings. It is not something that should be taken away from the new generations; it is something that should be experienced by all. My wish is to help the Arts however I can, and to let our young be able to take part in creating music, and seeing the joy that it can bring in doing so.
